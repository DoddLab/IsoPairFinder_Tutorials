The unlabeled data and labeled data were processed respectively.\n2. **Merging adduct, neutral losses, and in-source fragments**: The potential substrate ions that were identified in the unlabeled data were used to retrieve and merge the related features (e.g., adduct, neutral losses, and in-source fragments) to avoid false positives. The extracted ion chromatography (EIC) of ions was also retrieved and checked. \n3. **Feature pairing between unlabeled and labeled data**: The reserved substrate ions of unlabeled data were used for chemical formula prediction and further confirming it by searching for pairing substrate ions in the labeled data.\n\n![Overview of the IsoPairFinder workflow.](/images/figure3_1.png){ width=50% .align-center #fig-figure3-1}\n \n## Running IsoPairFinder and Parameters {#sec-isoPairFinder-parameters}\nThe basic use of `IsoPairFinder` is simply running the R script as below:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# run the IsoPairFinder workflow\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(IsoPairFinder)\n# analysis of HyuA\nfind_intemidates(peak_table_unlabel = 'peak_table_C12.csv',\n                 peak_table_label = 'peak_table_C13.csv',\n                 sample_info = 'sample_info.xlsx',\n                 path = '~/Project/00_Uric_Acid_project/Data/20250606_isopairfind_test/Demo_data_msdial/',\n                 polarity = 'positive',\n                 control_group = c(\"WT\"),\n                 case_group = c('MUTANT'),\n                 mz_tol = 10,\n                 rt_tol = 0.05,\n                 p_value_cutoff = 0.05,\n                 p_adjust = TRUE,\n                 fold_change_cutoff = 20,\n                 is_recognize_adducts = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `find_intemidates` function is the main function of the IsoPairFinder package, which runs the whole workflow to identify potential intermediates from stable isotope tracing metabolomics data.\n\nThe parameters are provided below:\n\n- peak_table_unlabel: the feature table name of the unlabeled group. The default file name, “peak_table_C12.csv”. See the requirements in @sec-data-preparation.\n- peak_table_label: the feature table name of the unlabeled group. The default, “peak_table_C13.csv”.  See the requirements in @sec-data-preparation.\n- sample_info: the sample information table. See the requirements in @sec-data-preparation.\n- path: the working path.\n- polarity: ionization polarity, “positive” or “negative”. Default: “positive”\n- control_group: the control group, e.g., “WT”. The group names should be included in the sample information table.\n- case_group: the case group, e.g., “MUTANT”. The group names should be included in the sample information table.\n- mz_tol: m/z tolerance (unit: ppm) for searching the intermediate ions. Default: 10 ppm\n- rt_tol: retention time tolerance (unit: minute) for searching the intermediate ions. Default: 0.05 min\n- p_value_cutoff: the cutoff of p-value (t-test). Default: 0.05\n- p_adjust: whether to perform the multiple comparison correction (FDR adjustment). Default: TRUE\n- fold_change_cutoff: the cutoff of fold-change (case vs. control). Default: 20\n- is_recognize_adduct: whether to recognize and merge the isotopes, adducts, and in-source fragments. Default: TRUE\n\n## Output {#sec-isoPairFinder-output}\nThe new folder `“00_tracer_result”` will be generated in the working directory (@fig-figure1-2), including “tracer_pair_result.xlsx” and several plots in PDF files.\nSpecifically, these files are provided in the result folder:\n\n- **tracer_pair_result.xlsx**: This file contains the results from differential analysis, recognized features, and identified substrate feature pairs. It has 4 sheets:\n\n    - **raw_data_unlabeled**: the differential analysis of the unlabeled group. Some columns below were added to the unlabeled feature table, including p-values, q-values, fold changes, etc.\n    - **raw_data_labeled**: the differential analysis of the labeled group. Some columns below were added to the unlabeled feature table, including p-values, q-values, fold changes, etc.\n    - **recognized_peak_unlabel**: the table of recognized adducts, neutral loss, and in-source fragments (@fig-figure3-2). The method used here was followed from a previous publication @zhou_metabolite_2022. Some key column definitions:\n        - base_peak: the base peaks that are used to recognize the adducts and in-source fragments.\n        - relationship: the relationship with the base peak.\n        - num_annotation: the number of features that belong to the same group.\n        - group_order: the feature group ID.\n    - **paired_table**: the table of possible substrate ion pairs identified. Each row represents one pair of substrate ions (@fig-figure3-2). Specifically,\n        - unlabeled_feature_id/mz/rt: the property (id, mz, rt) of substrate in the unlabeled group.\n        - labled_feature_id/mz/rt: the property (id, mz, rt) of substrate in the labeled group\n        - mass_shift_label: the estimated carbon number\n        - p_values/fold_changes/average_abundance: the statistics of differential analysis\n- “**volcano_plot_unlabeled.pdf**” / “**volcano_plot_labeled.pdf**”: the volcano plots that show a significant accumulation between the case (mutant) and control groups. \n- “**isotope_pair_plot_overview.pdf**”: the overview of the EIC mirror for identified substrate ion pairs.\n- “**isotope_pair_list.pdf**”: the lists of EIC mirror plots for identified substrate ion pairs. \n- “**00_intermediate_data**”: the intermediate data during processing. It was used for debugging.\n\n![The screenshot of the tracer pair result table](/images/figure3_2.png){.align-center #fig-figure3-2}",
