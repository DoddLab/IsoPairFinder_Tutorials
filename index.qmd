# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Understanding metabolic pathways in gut microbes is crucial for advancing microbiome research, yet identifying specific metabolic intermediates remains challenging due to the complexity of LC-MS data analysis. IsoPairFinder is a novel tool designed to streamline Stable Isotope Tracing (SIT) metabolomics from gene-edited microbes, enabling efficient identification of pathway intermediates and gene functions. IsoPairFinder offers an end-to-end workflow that: (1) Detects differential ion signals resulting from gene mutations; (2) Consolidates redundant LC-MS features (isotopes, adducts, fragments); (3) Pairs ¹²C/¹³C features to highlight candidate intermediates. Compatible with popular metabolomics data processing tools, IsoPairFinder empowers researchers to rapidly generate actionable biological insights. This tutorial provides step-by-step guidance for using **IsoPairFinder**.
