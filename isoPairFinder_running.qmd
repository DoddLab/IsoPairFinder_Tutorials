# IsoPairFinder running {#sec-isoPairFinder-running}

## Overview of the IsoPairFinder workflow
Generally, the `IsoPairFinder` processes the stable isotope tracing (STI) metabolomics data via 3 steps (@fig-figure3-1): (1) differential analysis; (2) recognition of adduct, neutral loss, and in-source fragment; (3) feature pairing between unlabeled and labeled data.

1. **Differential analysis**: Identifying the possible accumulated substrates by comparing mutant and control groups. The unlabeled data and labeled data were processed respectively.
2. **Merging adduct, neutral losses, and in-source fragments**: The potential substrate ions that were identified in the unlabeled data were used to retrieve and merge the related features (e.g., adduct, neutral losses, and in-source fragments) to avoid false positives. The extracted ion chromatography (EIC) of ions was also retrieved and checked. 
3. **Feature pairing between unlabeled and labeled data**: The reserved substrate ions of unlabeled data were used for chemical formula prediction and further confirming it by searching for pairing substrate ions in the labeled data.

## Running IsoPairFinder and Parameters {#sec-isoPairFinder-parameters}
The basic use of `IsoPairFinder` is simply running the R script as below:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# run the IsoPairFinder workflow
library(tidyverse)
library(IsoPairFinder)
# analysis of HyuA
find_intemidates(peak_table_unlabel = 'peak_table_C12.csv',
                 peak_table_label = 'peak_table_C13.csv',
                 sample_info = 'sample_info.xlsx',
                 path = '~/Project/00_Uric_Acid_project/Data/20250606_isopairfind_test/Demo_data_msdial/',
                 polarity = 'positive',
                 control_group = c("WT"),
                 case_group = c('MUTANT'),
                 mz_tol = 10,
                 rt_tol = 0.05,
                 p_value_cutoff = 0.05,
                 p_adjust = TRUE,
                 fold_change_cutoff = 20,
                 is_recognize_adducts = TRUE)
```

The `find_intemidates` function is the main function of the IsoPairFinder package, which runs the whole workflow to identify potential intermediates from stable isotope tracing metabolomics data.

The parameters are provided below:

- peak_table_unlabel: the feature table name of the unlabeled group. The default file name, “peak_table_C12.csv”. See the requirements in @sec-data-preparation.
- peak_table_label: the feature table name of the unlabeled group. The default, “peak_table_C13.csv”.  See the requirements in @sec-data-preparation.
- sample_info: the sample information table. See the requirements in @sec-data-preparation.
- path: the working path.
- polarity: ionization polarity, “positive” or “negative”. Default: “positive”
- control_group: the control group, e.g., “WT”. The group names should be included in the sample information table.
- case_group: the case group, e.g., “MUTANT”. The group names should be included in the sample information table.
- mz_tol: m/z tolerance (unit: ppm) for searching the intermediate ions. Default: 10 ppm
- rt_tol: retention time tolerance (unit: minute) for searching the intermediate ions. Default: 0.05 min
- p_value_cutoff: the cutoff of p-value (t-test). Default: 0.05
- p_adjust: whether to perform the multiple comparison correction (FDR adjustment). Default: TRUE
- fold_change_cutoff: the cutoff of fold-change (case vs. control). Default: 20
- is_recognize_adduct: whether to recognize and merge the isotopes, adducts, and in-source fragments. Default: TRUE

## Output {#sec-isoPairFinder-output}
The new folder `“00_tracer_result”` will be generated in the working directory (@fig-figure1-2), including “tracer_pair_result.xlsx” and several plots in PDF files.
Specifically, these files are provided in the result folder:

- **tracer_pair_result.xlsx**: This file contains the results from differential analysis, recognized features, and identified substrate feature pairs. It has 4 sheets:

    - **raw_data_unlabeled**: the differential analysis of the unlabeled group. Some columns below were added to the unlabeled feature table, including p-values, q-values, fold changes, etc.
    - **raw_data_labeled**: the differential analysis of the labeled group. Some columns below were added to the unlabeled feature table, including p-values, q-values, fold changes, etc.
    - **recognized_peak_unlabel**: the table of recognized adducts, neutral loss, and in-source fragments (@fig-figure3-2). The method used here was followed from a previous publication @zhou_metabolite_2022. Some key column definitions:
        - base_peak: the base peaks that are used to recognize the adducts and in-source fragments.
        - relationship: the relationship with the base peak.
        - num_annotation: the number of features that belong to the same group.
        - group_order: the feature group ID.
    - **paired_table**: the table of possible substrate ion pairs identified. Each row represents one pair of substrate ions (@fig-figure3-2). Specifically,
        - unlabeled_feature_id/mz/rt: the property (id, mz, rt) of substrate in the unlabeled group.
        - labled_feature_id/mz/rt: the property (id, mz, rt) of substrate in the labeled group
        - mass_shift_label: the estimated carbon number
        - p_values/fold_changes/average_abundance: the statistics of differential analysis
- “**volcano_plot_unlabeled.pdf**” / “**volcano_plot_labeled.pdf**”: the volcano plots that show a significant accumulation between the case (mutant) and control groups. 
- “**isotope_pair_plot_overview.pdf**”: the overview of the EIC mirror for identified substrate ion pairs.
- “**isotope_pair_list.pdf**”: the lists of EIC mirror plots for identified substrate ion pairs. 
- “**00_intermediate_data**”: the intermediate data during processing. It was used for debugging.
